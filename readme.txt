This is a little project for a tool which can be used to generate a report documenting sequence validations after plasmid sequencing. 
Made during my DPhil to assist and speed up this validation/archiving process.
Not to be taken too seriously :)

Requires:
-python
-long form instructions see instructions.txt
-requirements see requirements.txt
-blastn from here ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
