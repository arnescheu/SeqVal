DO NOT SUBMIT SEQUENCE VALIDATION FILES AS THEY ARE GENERATED!!!
This tool is meant to make it faster and easier on you,
but you still have to go through everything and check it yourself.
AT LEAST:
	check that everything is OK
	go through file and adjust read areas (it gives you Start-First Error, Last Error-End, not region of interest)
	comment on how you interpret traces
	at the top and bottom is a big red warning row to remind you!
	save a new file and without _aSV in filename ("Automated sequence validation")
It is your responsibility - I am not taking responsibility if something goes wrong...
But if you do notice any irregularities, please talk to me.

FIRST-TIME SETUP
1) Install python from here https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Install packages after installing python. Type in terminal:
	python -mpip install biopython
	python -mpip install matplotlib
	python -mpip install requests
	[If this fails, you probably don't have python installed correctly.]
	[If you want to use automatic conversion to doc in windows ("-w2d" flag) you also need pywin32: python -mpip install pywin32]
3) Install blastn from here: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
    Test by typing "blastn" in terminal. If you get a message like this then all is installed fine: "BLAST query/options error: Either a BLAST..."
4) Test if everything works by using the files in the example folder
	[Set terminal directory to the folder or use -wd "working directory" flag to set folder]

Flags to use in terminal (see "FOR REGULAR USE - 3)":
    Flags followed by string:
	-u "username" (default to system user)
	-wd "working directory" (default to current terminal directory)
    Flag toggles:
    -aa (annotation area; provide nucleotide stretches for annotations, e.g. His6 (nt 9-26), default False) #suggestion by Anne-Marie
	-lc (labelcolor; use label color scheme from genbank file, default False)
	-v (verbosity; turns verbosity of output OFF, i.e. less cluttered output, default True)
	-w2d (windows to .doc; automatic conversion form .htm to .doc, only on windows, default False)

FOR REGULAR USE
1) Get your ab1 files. Genbank files can be exported from benchling. Put the ones you want for your sequence validation into one folder
2) Open the task.txt in excel. Define which sequences belong to which genbank files, add names, etc.
    - Define multiple sequence traces to one file by adding columns ("sequencing_3","sequencing_4"...), or by separating them with ";" within a field
        - Do not leave column titles blank if you put values in! This crashes the program
    - In task.txt, also provide the region of interest, by giving a region (150:210) or sequence ("ATG....TAA")
        - Alternatively, a feature in the genbank file called "GOI" also works. Priority is region>sequence>"GOI"
    - Save as tab seperated values, task.txt
3) Run the file in terminal (see "flags to use":
        python PYTHONFILE -wd FILEFOLDER -u USERNAME -v -aa ...
    for example:
        python "C:\\Users\\Arne Scheu\\Download\\AS2018-06-06_SeqVal\\seq_val\\seq_val.py" -wd "C:\\Users\\Arne Scheu\\Download\\AS2018-06-06_SeqVal\\example"
    or:
        cd "Downloads\\AS2018-06-06_SeqVal"
        python "seq_val\\seq_val.py" -u "Arne Scheu"
4) Open .htm files, copy contents to word document. Should have correct formatting
    - If running windows, you can use the label "-w2d" for automatic conversion. Close word first.
5) IMPORTANT: Adjust read areas, it gives you some information (first mismatch, last mismatch, largest frame of two mismatches)

SOME POTENTIAL ERRORS:
If you get a warning or exception (i.e. it crashes), it should tell you what went wrong. Ask me if you want to know more.
Aside from that:
1) I think your gene should not go through 0 in your sequence. This probably doesn't work.
2) Parts missing from final file
	- Did you provide genbank and ab1 correctly? Did you fill out fields?
3) Labels in genbank file not annotated
	- The program only uses labels with the type "CDS" or "protein". A feature labelled "GOI" is used to define region and otherwise ignored
	- Strand -1 is ignored
	- Only 2 overlapping layers of features are recognized. The inner one will be bold
4) Label colors are not the same as in genbank/benchling
	- This is intentional, as people usually have ugly colors in the genbank file...
	- The color scheme: colors = ["navy", "green", "orange", "red", "purple", "mint", "olive", "maroon", "coral", "brown", "gold"]
	    - 	Note: This can give an index error if you have more features than colors (if they are not filtered out, see above).
	    - 	In this case, it could be better to use colors by label. Use the flag "-lc"
	- If you don't like the color scheme, you can change it (at the bottom of the seq_val.py file).
	    - If you want to share, tell me your favorite!
5) My .htm files don't have images!
	- htm files don't save images, just provide a path. You moved or overwrote a file. Copy to word to make it permanent
